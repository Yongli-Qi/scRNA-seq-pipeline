# scRNA-seq-pipeline
single cell RNA-seq pipeline (SCLC and NSCLC)

The expression levels of 20,802,247 cells from 19 SCLC patient samples, 22 NSCLC patient samples and 4 normal tissue samples were downloaded from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) (https://data.humantumoratlas.org/). The orignal data was submitted by Chan et al. (2021). The processing of single-cell data was primarily conducted using the Seurat platform (version 5).

For the analysis process, please follow the order of the folders from run01* to run12*. The two files, sc-RNA_seq_pipeline_part1.html and sc-RNA_seq_pipeline_part2.html, provide flowcharts used for the analysis. The pipeline and algorithms are based on Chan et al. (2021), with some modifications made to the original framework.
